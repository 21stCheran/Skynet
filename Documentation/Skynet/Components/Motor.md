Motor size is typically denoted by a four-digit number (e.g., 2207), which refers to the stator's diameter (22 mm) and height (7 mm). Generally, a larger stator volume correlates with higher torque production. The motor's KV rating refers to revolutions per minute per volt.

**Low-KV Motors (e.g., 100-900 KV):** 
- More windings
- Higher torque
- Lower RPM
- Best fit for large propellers 

**High-KV Motors (e.g., 1700-2500+ KV):**
 - Less windings
 - Lower torque
 - Much higher RPM
 - Best fit for small propellers and fast FPV like drones
